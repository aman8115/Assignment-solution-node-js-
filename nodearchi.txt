# use cases of node js

1. spa  single page application 
2. Real time application
3. Data streeaming app 
4. online chat paltform .
5. other web app 
6. making server

# Architechture of node js

using follwing step we can easiely understand architecture of node js .

# web application

web application is a program that runs on the server. it devides into three part 

1.Client

2.server

3.Database

# Client

clinet is the front-end part of the application . the fornt-end is useally developed by html and css ., javascript and thier library like angular , react .it send a request to server and take response from the server for the user . 

# Server

server is the second part of  the web application . it takes request from the client and sends response to client . it fetch data from the database and external resource  and then provides response to the client . the server is developed by PHP , NODE JS , JAVA. 

# Database

Database is the third part of the web appliaction . Database stores data for web application . the data can be  created , updated , deleted, whenever the client send a request . mongodb, mysql are the most popular technologies in use to create database.

# Main arcitec

1. Request
2. node.js (Server)
3. Event queue
4. Thread poll 
5. Event loop
6. External resource

# Request

Request can be blocking { complex} and non-blocking depending on user that what deos he want

# Node server

It is the side plateform that takes request and send response to client . 

# Event Queue

event queue stores the  incomming client request nad passes one by one into event loop

# Event loop

event loop is  working  every time . it takes request from the event queue and process them and returns response corrsponding  clients.

# External Resources.

if the node server does not find in the database . in this case server fetch data from the external resources.
